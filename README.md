# A-Neural-Algorithm-of-Artistic-Style-Paper-Implementation
Tensorflow implementation of paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

#### In this notebook, we'll implement the paper and reconstruct the results of the said paper. The steps of the process is as follows. Also, the notebook is created to facilitate _self-learning_ approach.

_Step 1: Preprocessing the input image_

_Step 2: Computing the output for selected layers for the content image and all the layers for style image._

_Step 3: What are loss functions in this problem and computing the loss functions._

_Step 3A: Content Loss for reconstruction of the content image._
      
_Step 3B: Style Loss for reconstruction of the style from a style image irrespective of content placement of the image._
      
_Step 4: Creating combined Tensorflow model, running it to minimize both the losses and optimize the input noise variable._

Pre-trained VGG16 tensorflow model along with helper files. Big shoutout to the owner. Also, vgg16.npy can be downloaded from the link provided in this repository. I have modified the vgg16.py file to facilitate average pooling instead of max pooling.
